Hello High Achiever,

<p>
  Have you ever been interrupted just as you were getting your <span class="lead-text">breakthrough</span> or right when you got into a <span class="lead-text">flow state?</span>
  <br>
  Everyone needs blocks of uninterrupted time for deep productive work. That is when the real work gets done.
</p>
<p>
  <span class="lead-text">The best way</span> to get focused work done consistently is to work in fixed focus periods. Those are much easier to protect against distractions.
  <br>
No matter how important you are, the world can survive for 25 minutes without your attention.
  </p>
<h3>Advanced Pomodoro module</h3>
<p>
  The Pomodoro technique specifies short work periods, usually 25 mins, for focused work, with 5 minute breaks in-between.
  <br>
  However LifeHQ allows you to specify custom work and break periods for each session.
</p>
<p>I work in 45/10 minute cycles for programming work and 25/5 cycles for marketing and admin stuff at LifeHQ.
  <br>
  It's nothing special until you take it seriously, just like everything in life.
</p>

<p>
The magic happens when you prepare the right way. <br>
  At LifeHQ I've added specific preparation and conclusion questions to
get you closer to achieving flow even before you start.
  </p>

<p>
  Before you start answer these short questions so your mind starts working towards solution before starting.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <span class="lead-text">What</span> are you working on?
  </li>
  <li>
    <span class="lead-text">How</span> will you get started?
  </li>
  <li>
    Possible <span class="lead-text">blockers</span> and how to handle them.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Check yourself at the end of each cycle to detect <span class="lead-text"> tiredness, procrastination or simply trying to do too much at once.</span>
