Hey Rockstar, are you journaling right?

<p>I used to hate journaling until I started doing it right. <br>
  Until I started writing about the things important to me, my goals.</p>
<p>
  Writing about your goals, how you are moving forward or even what is setting you back helps to keep them in the front of your mind and in your subconscious.
</p>
<p>
  After few days your subconscious magically starts popping out new ideas and solutions in your head.
</p>

<p>
At LifeHQ I created 4 journal types, Year, Month, Week and Day, designed to provide different levels of perspective.
  </p>

<ul class="my-list">
  <li>
    <span class="lead">Year journal</span> - Define the major goals for the year using the S.M.A.R.T. strategy. It makes them concrete, actionable and achievable.
  </li>
  <li>
<span class="lead">Month and Week</span> - These serve the same purpose to break down your active goals into manageable pieces. Personally I only use the Week because it is easier to predict what I can accomplish in 7 days instead of 30.
  </li>
  <li>
<span class="lead">Day journal</span> - (My favorite) This is the journal you use to get yourself going in the morning and to reflect on the day in the evening. Reflection is a powerful tool to notice patters of productive or unproductive behavior throughout your day. The daily journal will help you master self reflection.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>All journals come with templates specifically designed for organization, productivity and overall awesomeness.</p>
