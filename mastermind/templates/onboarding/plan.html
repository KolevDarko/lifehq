Greetings Go-Getter,

<p>We all know early morning is the most productive period of our day.</p>
<p>We also know to work on the most difficult thing first. We can remember that one important thing in our head, so no reason for making a todo list in the evening right?</p>
<p><b>Wrong!</b> <b>Dead Wrong!</b></p>
  <p>You will work on your urgent thing first, finish it, great. Then you procrastinate on your important things because you don't have a clear plan.
    <br>
    You look over your 20+ tasks and don't know where to start.</p>

<p>
Make the decisions the night before. <br>
  Pick the tasks that must be done the next day and order them by priority. <br> <br>
  Next morning when you wake up, pick the first one on the list and start crushing it. <br>
  </p>

<h3>The daily master list</h3>

<h3>The LifeHQ daily master list is split into three sections. Derived from the <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/ft-docs/en/covey-matrix.png">Eisenhower priority matrix</a></h3>
<ul>
  <li>
   <b>Urgent</b> - Tasks that must get done today
  </li>
  <li>
   <b>Important</b> - Non urgent tasks that move you closer to your goals.
  </li>
  <li>
   <b>Extra</b> - For everything else. Non urgent and non important things.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>For the long term planners we also have weekly planner.</h3>
<p>The weekly planner lets you schedule tasks the important tasks full week in advance. <br>
This gets automatically synced with your daily list on midnight.
  </p>

<p>
Separating the planning phase and the working phase will easily save you 1 hour in the morning.
