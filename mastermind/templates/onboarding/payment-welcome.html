Hi there Future Millionaire,

<p>
Thank you for giving LifeHQ a true chance to get you organized, productive, consistent
and improve all areas of your life.
  </p>

<p>
It is not until we actually invest in something that we experience the true value it provides.
</p>

<h4>If you need help with your productivity in general, shoot me an email at <a href="mailto:darko@lifehqapp.com">darko@lifehqapp.com</a> </h4>

<p>
You have my ear about anything regarding the LifeHQ app itself (what's missing, what's bad, what's good)
and anything else you might be strugling with in your journey toward your goals.
</p>

To your success <br>

Darko <br>
Founder, LifeHQ
