Hi there future Millionaire,

<p>
  We all have goals and ideas for changing the world, but guess what, everyone else has them too. <br>
What separates the winners is they execute their ideas, one step at a time.
</p>
<p>
Start by taking the first step right in front of you: <br>
Pick a goal that's important to you and create a project for it.
</p>

<h3><a href="http://app.lifehqapp.com/projects#new">Create project</a></h3>

<p>
  <b>Next:</b> What are the first three things you need to do for this project? <br>
When you figure them out, write them in a task list.
  </p>

<p>
The process of splitting big projects into small tasks makes them much more achievable.
  <br>
  With every task you finish you are getting closer to your goals and your confidence that you can achieve them grows every day.
  </p>
