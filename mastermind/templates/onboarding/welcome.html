Hi there Rockstar,

<p>Welcome to LifeHQ, glad to have you on board.</p>

<p>LifeHQ promises increased organization, productivity and consistency.<br>
Tall order I know. <br>
That is why it's an all-in-one system instead of a single tool.</p>

<p>Single tools are like motorcycles that go 100 meters in 5 seconds. Fast for small distances.</p>

<p>LifeHQ is an airplane that is slower to take off but once in the air it will take you to other continents. </p>

<h3>How the system works:</h3>

<ol>
  <li>
   <span class="lead-text">Journal</span> - Define and crystalize your goals. Reflect on them often.
    Keep them in the front of your mind.
  </li>
  <li>
    <span class="lead-text">Projects</span> - Goals are only Dreams until they become projects.
  </li>
  <li>
    <span class="lead-text">Work</span> - LifeHQ helps you to actually work better. Prioritize with our Master list and boost your productivity with our Pomodoro module.
  </li>
  <li>
    <span class="lead-text">Win every day</span> - Feel the win after completing all daily assignments.
Visible from every screen to remind you how close you are to the finish.
Get the feeling of accomplishment at the end of every day.
  </li>
  <li>
    <span class="lead-text">Habits</span> - Reap the benefits of staying consistent with the things you know
you should be doing for your physical and mental health and wellbeing.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  The <b>most important</b> thing for last, none of these things will work for you unless
you commit to use them. <br>
  I suggest starting with one goal, one project, one habit and at least one pomodoro session per day.
</p>

<p>
  In the next 5 days I will send you one short email per day that highlights each of the 5 modules, <br>
  how to make the most of them and experience the true benefit of a productivity system.
</p>

To your new accomplishments and success.<br>
