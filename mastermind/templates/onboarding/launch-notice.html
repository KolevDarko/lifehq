Hi fellow Early Bird,

<h3> The official LifeHQ Launch is here and there are some goodies for you. </h3>

<h3>But first things first.</h3>

<h3> Thank you </h3>
<p>
Thank you for your interest in <a href="http://lifehqapp.com">LifeHQ</a> while it was still in the early stages with all the rough edges and the occasional bug.
  </p>
<p>
Your interest is what helped me validate the idea for this crazy mix of project management, productivity and self improvement and is what motivated me to continue pushing until the end. For that I am forever grateful.
  </p>

<h2> Your reward </h2>
<p>
As a reward you get a discount code that gives you 50% off LifeHQ forever, the discount code is: tnx-1337-lfhq <br>
 Make sure to use it until June 1st. (On the checkout popup you will see the Add coupon button and that's where you enter the code.)
    </p>

<h3><a href="http://my.lifehqapp.com/billing">Yes, I'm in</a></h3>

<h2>LifeHQ is ready for you</h2>
<p>
I have been using LifeHQ exclusively for the past 6 months for managing all aspects of my life. Organization, project management, working productively, tracking my habits and journaling.
</p>
<p>
To be honest, my biggest struggle has always been the consistency part (I am still working on it). Usually on weekends I tend to over relax and lose my momentum from the previous week.
  <br>
The best thing from a system like LifeHQ is how easy it is to get back on track after a bad weekend. <br>
  I have everything already defined in there and I just need to have one productive day to get back on the right path.
</p>

<h2>What to expect</h2>
With the official launch I have prepared a sequence of a few emails explaining the different LifeHQ modules and how they all fit together. Expect to receive one per day for the next few days, of course you can opt out of those as well.

In case you forgot what LifeHQ was <a href="http://lifehqapp.com">Check this out.</a>

PS: And a special thank you to everyone that provided feedback via the live chat, I was a few weeks late to see thos but I did reply to everyone eventually.

To your success <br>

Darko <br>
Founder, LifeHQ
