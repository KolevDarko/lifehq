Hi there future Millionaire,

<p>
  There are a million personal productivity apps out there.<br>
  <h3> What sets LifeHQ apart is the ability to organize, prioritize and work productively, all in one place. </h3>
</p>

<h2>How</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Organize with projects.</li>
  <li>Plan & Prioritize with our daily and weekly Master lists.</li>
  <li>Work productively with our focused timer sessions.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Let's start at the beginning: Make your ideas concrete with projects</h2>

<p>
  Projects are the best way to move your ideals and goals out of your head and into reality. <br>
  I create projects for everything that takes me longer than one day to complete. <br>
</p>
  <p>
  They consist of <b>Tasks</b>, <b>Schedule</b> and <b>Resources</b>.

<p>
  <b>Next:</b> What are the first three things you need to do for this project? <br>
    When you figure them out, write them in a task list.
  </p>

  For the Kanban style fans out there we got you covered as well.

<p>
The process of splitting big projects into small tasks makes them much more achievable.
  <br>
  With every task you finish you are getting closer to your goals and your confidence grows every day.
