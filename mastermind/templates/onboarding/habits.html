Howdy Habit master,

<p>
It is very easy to get caught up in the pursuit of your goals and neglect everything else. <br>
I'm talking about neglecting your health, both physical and mental, which forms the basis for all accomplishment. <br>
</p>
<p>
This is the exact reason I built the LifeHQ habits module.
</p>

<p>
Start tracking the things you know you should be doing but aren't. <br>
If you start talking shortcuts with your health sooner or later you will start talking shortcuts
  with your business and everything else.
</p>
<h4>  How you do anything is how you do everything. Stay on point in all things. </h4>

  Track your healthy habits and form the foundation for your energy, productivity and success.

<p>Or</p>

<h4>If you need help with your productivity in general, shoot me an email at <a href="mailto:darko@lifehqapp.com">darko@lifehqapp.com</a> </h4>

Cheers for dicipline in all things <br>
